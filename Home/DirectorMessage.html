        Dear Scholars, Students, and Sports Enthusiasts,</p>
      <p class="text-wrap fs-5">
        Welcome to the Dhyansport Institute of Sports & Physical Education Research—a premier academic and research hub
        dedicated to the pursuit of excellence in sports science, physical education, wellness, and allied disciplines.
      </p>

        As the Director, it is both my professional responsibility and personal honor to lead this institute, which
        operates under the aegis of the DhyanSport Sports & Physical Education Foundation, a Section 8 non-profit
        organization. This institute is a living tribute to my late father, whose principles of discipline, knowledge,
        and service continue to guide my journey. His lifelong commitment to education and integrity fuels the very
        mission of Dhyansport—to build a stronger, healthier, and more aware society through evidence-based physical
        education and sport.</p>
      <p class="text-wrap fs-5">The Institute is committed to:

        <li>
          Offering cutting-edge certificate, diploma, and advanced-level courses aligned with national and international
          standards;
        </li>
        <li>Promoting interdisciplinary research and scholarly innovation through the Indian Journal of Sports Studies
          (ISSN 2229-3558);</li>
        <li>Fostering thought leadership and collaboration through our professional bodies—the Indian Society of Sports
          Scientists and the Indian Association of Sports Anthropometry;</li>
        <li>Serving the nation by nurturing talent, enhancing grassroots sports development, and contributing to public
          health and well-being.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

        At Dhyansport, we bridge tradition and technology, fieldwork and theory, rural and global perspectives—creating
        an inclusive platform for future educators, researchers, fitness professionals, and change-makers.</p>
      <p class="text-wrap fs-5">
